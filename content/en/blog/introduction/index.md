Constructing the gene regulatroy network of the periderm using single-cell RNA-Seq data and LASSO-based methods.

We compare multiple network construction methods: Stability LASSO, Graphical LASSO, mLASSO-StARS, GENIE3, and WGCNA. Our goal is to reconstruct the periderm GRN which will help us identify key components of the network that might be integral in orofacial development. The initial application is on zebrafish with future extensions to mice. Both zebrafish and mice serve as model organisms in the study of human periderm and orofacial development more broadly.
